# Shopping_Cart_Application
I built a full-stack e-commerce application using React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to provide a seamless shopping experience. The app features dynamic product fetching, a responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, a Redux-managed shopping cart, and smooth navigation with React Router. Itâ€™s a solo project that strengthened my full-stack development skills.
